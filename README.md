**Objective:** The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether an individual is likely to experience a heart attack based on various health indicators.

- **Data:** The dataset includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved (`thalachh`), and others. The target variable (`output`) indicates whether the individual had a heart attack (1) or is healthy (0).
- **Techniques:**
  - **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between variables, such as age and `thalachh`, identifying a moderate negative correlation.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduced dimensionality to highlight the most significant features influencing heart attack prediction.
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Used to find the linear combinations of features that best separate healthy individuals from those who had a heart attack.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Applied both linear and non-linear kernels, with the non-linear SVM showing superior performance.
  - **Neural Networks:** Implemented to explore deeper patterns in the data, with a focus on avoiding overfitting.
- **Results:**
  - **Best Model:** The non-linear SVM achieved the highest accuracy at 92.1%.
  - **Insights:** While neural networks showed potential, they also posed a risk of overfitting, particularly with more complex architectures.
- **Visualizations:** Scatter plots, PCA explained variance, decision boundaries for SVM, and model performance charts.
- **Conclusion:** The project illustrates the application of various machine learning techniques in medical diagnostics, with the non-linear SVM model offering the best balance between accuracy and generalizability.

- **Techniques:**
  - **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing words.
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converted text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, capturing the importance of words in each message.
  - **Modeling:** Tested several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
- **Results:**
  - **Best Model:** The Naive Bayes classifier provided the highest accuracy, particularly excelling in identifying spam messages with an impressive F1-score.
  - **Confusion Matrix:** Displayed the model's performance, showing strong precision and recall for the spam class.
- **Visualizations:** Word clouds for common spam and ham terms, performance metrics for each model, and confusion matrices.
- **Conclusion:** The Naive Bayes model proved to be the most effective for this classification task, offering a good balance of speed and accuracy for text-based spam detection.

### Project 3. [NBA Salary Prediction Using Multiple Regression](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%203%20-%20NBA%20Salary%20Prediction%20(Multiple%20Reg%20w%3A%20R))

**Objective:** The goal of this project is to predict NBA player salaries based on performance metrics and other attributes using multiple regression models.

- **Data:** The dataset contains player statistics such as Points Per Game (PPG), Assists Per Game (APG), Rebounds Per Game (RPG), and corresponding salaries.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (like player positions), and scaled features to prepare the data for modeling.
  - **Modeling:** Implemented and compared several regression techniques:
    - **Linear Regression:** Used as a baseline model to predict salaries.
    - **Ridge Regression:** Applied L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity.
    - **Lasso Regression:** Employed L1 regularization to perform feature selection.
    - **ElasticNet Regression:** Combined both L1 and L2 regularization to balance feature selection and model complexity.
- **Results:**
